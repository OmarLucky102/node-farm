# node-farm
Simple Node.js project using core modules to build a dynamic product website with templating and a basic API
# 🌱 Node Farm

Node Farm is a beginner-friendly Node.js project that demonstrates how to build a dynamic product website using only core Node.js modules. It showcases essential backend engineering concepts such as routing, file I/O, dynamic HTML templating, and serving a basic API.

This project was created as part of my learning journey as an IT student focusing on backend development.

  Replacing placeholders in HTML templates with live JSON data.

- **REST API Endpoint:**  
  Serving product data as raw JSON through a simple API.

- **Slug Generation:**  
  Creating clean, readable URLs using the `slugify` package.

- **Modular Code Structure:**  
  Organizing code using custom reusable modules.
