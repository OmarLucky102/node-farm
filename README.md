Simple Node.js project using core modules to build a dynamic product website with templating and a basic API
# 🌱 Node Farm

Node Farm is a beginner-friendly Node.js project that demonstrates how to build a dynamic product website using only core Node.js modules. It showcases essential backend engineering concepts such as routing, file I/O, dynamic HTML templating, and serving a basic API.

This project was created as part of my learning journey as an IT student focusing on backend development.
